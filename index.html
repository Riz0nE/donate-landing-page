                <p class="our-work">Homelessness is a complex issue, sitting at the intersection of public health,
                    housing affordability,
                    domestic violence, mental illness, substance misuse, urbanization, racial and gender discrimination,
                    infrastructure, and unemployment. The interplay between these elements is expressed in a host of
                    ways depending upon local context. </p>

                <p class="our-work">Your support shows that lasting, large-scale change is possible. Last year, we
                    changed the lives of
                    over 2,623,000 children in Bangladesh. Together, we’re giving them the opportunities every child
                    deserves – to grow up healthy, learning and safe. </p>

                <p class="our-work">There are three distinct types of Education- Formal Education, Non-Formal Education,
                    and Informal
                    Education. Education aims to change the way of one’s thinking. Academic knowledge provides one
                    leaning on a global scale, while Practical knowledge is acquired for life on the whole.</p>

            <p>Our teams have distributed more than 40,000 meals to those displaced by
                floodwaters during the current crisis, and this emergency relief response continues.

                As the floodwaters recede, Our Recovery teams move into Recovery Hubs and begin
                to provide grants to those displaced by the floodwaters as well as providing emotional care.</p><br>
